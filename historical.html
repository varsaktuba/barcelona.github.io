		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">Barcelona is Spain's second largest metropolis and 
		one of its major travel destinations, the city of Gaudi and Catalonia's capital, a cultural hub, a culinary heaven, 
		and almost certainly the finest beach city in Europe. It is a cosmopolitan city with Roman remains, medieval quarters 
		and the most beautiful examples of 20th century Modernism and avant-garde. The city's origins are Roman, and its long history
		and economic dynamism have made Barcelona a cultural city, which can be seen in the historic-artistic heritage and the promotion of 
		the most innovative artistic trends. A wide cultural programme will take visitors to museums, exhibitions, open-air sculptures and many concerts,
		plays and dances.</font> </p>
		<h2> <center><font color="#FF9900"> La Sagrada Familia </font></center>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/924/jlU4qm.jpg" align="left"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">La Sagrada Familia inspires awe by its sheer verticality, and in the manner
		of the medieval cathedrals it emulates, it's still under construction. Work began in 1882 and is hoped (perhaps optimistically) to be completed
		in 2026, a century after the architect's death. Unfinished it may be, but it attracts around 2.8 million visitors a year and is the most visited 
		monument in Spain.</font> </p>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/923/8f9gH9.jpg" align="right"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">A beautiful souvenir is to climb the towers which offer an exceptional view of the 
		city and the aerial parts of the basilica. Two towers are now accessible by elevator: the tower of the nativity " Torre del Naixement " of 55 meters
		is the oldest and was built at the time of Gaudi. The tower of Passion "Torre de la Passio" high of 75 meters is the most recent. It is the latter 
		that offers the most spectacular view. The descent is done by the stairs..</font> </p>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/922/Xk2kho.jpg" align="left"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">Finally, a visit of the Museum is necessary to understand the creative journey of Gaudi 
		and its methods of construction. There are rough drafts, models and photos that explain the history and creation of the basilica, from its conception 
		to its future completion.</font> </p>
		<h2> <center><font color="#FF9900"> El Born </font></center>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/922/upvfR0.jpg" align="right"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">This is the most historically relevant of all Barcelona's neighborhoods.
		Most of the buildings here are centuries old and have no elevators; many streets are so narrow that there is a no-cars-allowed policy in the entire
		area. The Catalan resistance in the 1714 war is reflected in sites like El Fossar de les Moreres and El Museu del Born.</font> </p>
		
		<h2> <center><font color="#FF9900"> L'Eixample</font></center>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/923/tDIglY.jpg" align="left"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">The Eixample neighborhood is the 'newer' part of Barcelona; meaning it dates back
		to the late 1900's when the rise of Modernism gave way to luminaries such as Antoni Gaudi and Llius Domenech i Muntaner amongst their other 
		incredibly talented and innovative architects. The municipal plan (called Cerda) called for the creation of a large central square, so the 
		city could build around it in a new way.</font> </p>
		
		<h2> <center><font color="#FF9900"> Casa Batllo </font></center>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/923/Y4tDtC.jpg" align="right"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">The Casa Batllo (Casa Batllo) is the most original and dreamlike house of the architect
		Antoni Gaudi in Barcelona. Polychrome facade decorated with ceramic and glass, undulating roof allegory of Saint George killing the dragon. 
		The fundamental work of Catalan modernism, being Gaudi the incontestable leader. It was built between 1904 and 1906. Located at 43, Passeig 
		de Gracia, in the heart of the Eixample district and precisely in the center of the famous block called Manzana de la Discordia.</font> </p>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/924/HUTJN1.jpg" align="left"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">Faithful to his usual technique, Gaudi carries out very few plans and relies mainly on plaster models, 
		which he shapes until obtaining the sinuous forms that he desires. The Casa Batllo is known in Barcelona as the Casa dels ossos (House of the Bones),
		owing its name to its very original architecture: the balconies resemble fragments of skull with openings for eyes and nose. The columns 
		of the first-floor grandstand have the shape of human bones (tibia) and many other details of the facade makes us think of a skeleton.</font> </p>
		<h2> <center><font color="#FF9900"> Calatrava Tower</font></center>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/924/CkDvOc.jpg" align="right"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">Built by the architect Santiago Calatrava for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona,
		the Montjuic communications tower was a modern and innovative piece of architecture for that era. Rising up as a symbol at the heart of 
		the Olympic Ring, each day it attracts thousands of visitors. One can see the Calatrava tower from anywhere in Barcelona.</font> </p>
		<h2> <center><font color="#FF9900"> The Palace Virreina</font></center>
		<img src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/v2/320x240q90/924/R6ertj.jpg" align="left"/>
		<p><font face="Chaparral Pro Light" size="3" color="#000000">The building was erected between 1772 and 1777, 
		and entrusted to Manuel d'Amat I de Junyent (1704-1782) in order to be his place of residence in Barcelona. Manuel d'Amat was viceroy of
		Peru during fourteen years (1761-1776). He married Maria Francesca Fivaller i Bru in 1779. His widow outlived him twelve years, living in
		the building, which started to be known as the Virreina Palace because of this fact. It is decorated with both Baroque and Rococo elements, 
		which hosts major temporary exhibitions .It's now headquarters to the Town Hall's Cultural Department and its Centre de la Imatge (Image center).
		The exhibition centre shows works by some of Catalunya's most important contemporary artists, like Oriol Bohigas and Antoni Abad.</font> </p>
